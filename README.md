# SQL--ORDERBY
ORDER-BY is a clause in SQL used to sort the result set of a query. It helps to  sort results in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order.  Thouugh by default, SQL sorts in ascending order if you don’t specify. so here is typical example of what order-by looks like . 
Understanding ORDER BY in SQL
When you run a query in SQL, the database doesn’t guarantee the order of the rows it returns. That’s where ORDER BY comes in. It gives you control over how the results are arranged, making your data easier to read and work with.
How it works
Purpose: It organizes the rows returned by a SELECT statement.
Default behavior: If you don’t specify anything, results are sorted in ascending order (ASC).
Descending order: Use DESC to flip the sort.
Multiple columns: You can sort by more than one column, each with its own direction.

#ALIS
An alias in SQL is simply a temporary name you give to a table or a column in your query. It doesn’t change the actual name in the database 
it only exists while the query runs. Aliases make queries shorter, cleaner, and easier to read.
